I have tried to implement all asked functionality here authentication is using JWT token and github login is implemented, but due to some problem I am not able to merge the template and api so both jwt token auth and github auth working separately.

steps:
- Create virtualenv
- create superuser
- db used is postgresql
- do migrations and migrate
